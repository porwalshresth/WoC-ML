This is my first college project - A Machine Learning Library built from scratch - in Python language using only the external libraries - NumPy and Pandas only.
The following alogorithms are implemented from the Scratch:
Linear Regression,
Polynomial Regression
Binary Logistic Regression
Softmax Regression
K - Nearest Neighbours
K - Means Clustering
Decision Layers
Neural Network with weight initilizations and Normalizations.
Apart from this, there was an online Kaggle Competition hosted by my college club - CyberLabs - it also has code for them.
This is my first time using Github and any feedback, or suggestions related to the repository or improper structure or any changes would be most welcome.
